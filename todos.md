1. Create an GitHub ORG with a new standardized repo (an official fresh start)


2. Start Writing the report:
    - Define outline
    - Write about the developments so far


3. Make a python script to plot project management statistics from the excel









4. MLOps tasks:
    - Split the pipeline in sections for Quality Of Life improvements (faster 
      iteration speeds by selectively building only the required pieces each 
      time we update the code)
    - Add unit tests for both training and serving code
    - Add real staging tests (Right now Its just checking the health)
    - Add Continuous Training
    - Add Data Versioning 
    - Add a way to verify the canary is happening correctly

5. ML/AI tasks:
    - Address formally the challenge of a lot of data, small computational resources
    - Define a baseline pipeline
    - Iterate on new data pipelines

6. Define deadlines
    - **29/11/2025** Full deliverable project (Both code and the report)
